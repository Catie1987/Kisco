                <p>The history of soldering goes back about 5,000 years, but basic soldering always uses Sn-Pb flux consisting of tin and lead. However, groundwater lead pollution has been recognized as an environmental problem and the complete elimination of lead use is called for.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Realizing that protecting the environment is our duty in the 21st century, SMIC seriously expanded our research in this area and developed lead-free "ECO SOLDER".</p>
                <br>
                <p>In the soldering industry, the selection of quality solder is an important factor in ensuring the best welding results. And when it comes to quality and reliability, Senju's solder paste cannot be ignored. With years of experience and a commitment to research and development, Senju has built a reputation as a leading soldering iron brand and trusted by professionals worldwide. Whether you are a professional soldering engineer or a beginner in the field, Senju soldering iron will accompany you to create quality and reliable welds.</p>
